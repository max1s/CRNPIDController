# CRNPIDController
This is a repository for a CRN implementation of a PID controller.

To run the code (.gec) you will need a copy of free visual GEC which can be found online at:

Genetic Engineering of Living Cells - Microsoft Research
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/genetic-engineering-of-living-cells/

There are examples given with the software but here is a user manual:

Visual GEC Manual - Microsoft
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/.../gec-manual.pdf

Our code should be copy and pasteable in there and under //reference signal you can change this to whatever you want the chemical PID to track.

The code is commented but if anything is unclear please do not hesitate to message me.


When the paper associated with this project is published we will put a link to a URL. 

The contributors to this project are Luca Cardelli, Luca Laurenti, Max Whitby, Max Tchaikoswki, Mirco Tribastone, Marta Kwiatkowska.
